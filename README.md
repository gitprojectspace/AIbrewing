# AIbrewing
Sharing projects in the field of AI Automation and related topics.

## What is this Repository for?
This repository is for sharing a variety of contributions and projects on the topic of AI Automation, although it might span on related topics such as image and video editing, system setup, process optimization and similar. It will often contain the source code/workflow JSON for each individual project. 
The main purpose is sharing cutting-edge designs or useful solutions to common issues. I will shape this repository further as it grows.
